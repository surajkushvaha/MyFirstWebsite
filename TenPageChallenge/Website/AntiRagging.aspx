                <p>Ragging is a criminal offense. The UGC has framed regulations on curbing the menace
                    of ragging in higher educational institutions, in order to prohibit, prevent and
                    eliminate ragging. These regulations have been notified at the institute website.
                    Students are requested to go thoroughly and understand what constitutes ragging
                    and what are the responsibilities of institution's and students' to prevent such
                    incidents within the campus. Students are requested then to give the necessary undertaking
                    by them and parent's in the prescribed format in strict compliance of the UGC regulations.
                </p>

                <p>As per the superintendence of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, an Anti-Ragging Committee
                    has been constituted in our institution that rigorously deals with ragging incidents.
                    Each student is requested to have an introspection about the evils of ragging that
                    puts the reputation of the institution at stake, shatters the psyche of the victim
                    and spoils the future of the culprit. Each one of you is requested to behave in
                    the utmost friendly manner with fellow students without junior-senior discrimination
                    and help the newcomers settle comfortably and adjust to the campus life with your
                    unstinted support and guidance. If anyone suspects or comes to know about or becomes
                    a victim of ragging inside or outside the campus, please contact any of the anti-ragging
                    committee members.</p>
